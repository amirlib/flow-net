# Flow Networks - designer

Draw flow networks, witch include edges(with capacity and flow values) and nodes.  
You can calculate the maximum possible flow value of your created graph (using Edmonds Karp algorithm).  
The app implements [gca](https://github.com/amirlib/gca) module for representing Graphs and using the famous algorithms.
